=== syscfg.awk ===

This file in ~/BotWikiAwk/lib contains paths to dependencies and static strings.

When running setp.sh it is automatically configured. If it can't find a unix tool it 
will define the location as a blank string. This is not important, unless you need 
that tool for your bot. For example 'shuf' is rarely needed so don't worry that it's
missing - unless you need it, then install it, and manually add it's location to syscfg.

=== Email ===

BWA has support for sending email from any computer that has curl installed no other
dependencies are reqired. You will need an upstream SMTP server such as what an ISP
provides for POP3/IMAP email clients.

Email settings are in ~/BotWikiAwk/lib/syscfg.awk see that file for instructions.

=== Bot cfg ===

When creating a new bot, it will require configuration information. There are two 
locations cfg information can be placed, your choice. Each bot chooses one of the
two locations. Diffrent bots can use different location methods.

The advantage of location 2 is it keeps all information about the bot in a single 
file which makes its more portable and easier to maintain. Location 1 is the 
original design of BWA and maintained for backward compatibility. 

 ==== Location 1 ====

In ~/BotWikiAwk/lib/botwiki.awk there is a case statement where a block of code
defines the needed parameters for each bot. For example:

      case "accdate":                                          
        Home = "/home/admin/bots/" BotName "/"
        Agent = UserPage " (ask me about " BotName ")"
        Engine = 0
        break

Then at the top of the program, define the bot's name like this:

        BEGIN {
          BotName = "accdate"
        }

This block comes before the @include statements.

 ==== Location 2 ====

All cfg info resides in a BEGIN{} section at the top of the bot program. Nothing goes
in ~/BotWikiAwk/lib/botwiki.awk 

The configuration looks like this. Notice it comes before the @include statements

	BEGIN { # Bot cfg
	
	  _defaults = "home      = /home/admin/bots/accdate/ \
	               email     = sample@example.com \
	               version   = 1.0 \
	               copyright = 2024"

	  asplit(G, _defaults, "[ ]*[=][ ]*", "[ ]{9,}")
	  BotName = "accdate"
	  Home = G["home"]
	  Agent = "Ask me about " BotName " - " G["email"]    
	  Engine = 0

	}

	@include "botwiki.awk"
	@include "library.awk"

In this BEGIN{} block you can define the bot's home directory, email, BotName and Engine.

The options: 

        . _defaults - spacing is significant, there can be no blank spaces after each \, no tabs, the
           home directory should end with a / as seen above. See the ~/BotWikiAwl/example-bots for
           real examples. makebot can also create this section for you automatically. 
	. 'BotName' is the name of the directory defined in the _defaults which is also the name
           of the awk program. Thus, the BotName of "accdate" will be in the directory /home/admin/bots/accdate
           which contains a program accdate.awk
	. 'Agent' is the user-agent used by wget/curl - or you can create a global Agent in botwiki.awk
	. 'StopButton' is the URL to your bot's stop button page. If included here, it overrides the
	   global default set in botwiki.awk - if StopButton is blank, BWA won't check it.
	. 'Engine' is the parallel/concurrency method used for this bot:

	     0 = none or GNU Parallel on a single computer
	     1 = (Deprecated) Toolforge Array (single job submitted for all articles - fastest method)
	     2 = (Deprecated) Toolforge Jsub  (one job submitted per article - slower)       
	     3 = Non-framework eg. using upload() instead of runbot.awk       

           It is recommended to use Engine 0 for bots using the BotWikiAwk framework (eg. runbot, etc)
           For bots that are standalone tools, use Engine 3.

	   NOTE: As of 2024, Toolforge no longer supports SGE (Sun Grid Engine). BotWikiAwk will only
	         work in modes 0 or 3, for now. A future version of BWE will support the new
	         method of concurrency at Toolforge.
